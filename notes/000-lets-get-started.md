This is a repository to get more comfortable with a deep understanding of
haskell. I have been searching for a language that satisfies my need for some
kind of reliable, performant, expressive, and flexible langauge - so far I have
been unsatified with most all of the languages I have encountered except for
Haskell. To be fair I hear good things about modern C++, closure, and go which
all peak my interest - however my previous encounters with Haskell and my
preference for increasingly pure functional languages leads me to believe that
this is the community that I might like to start contributing more to.

This repo will be an experimental endeavor to explore more of the practical
aspects of Haskell. I will also assume no knowledge of the language, just in
case I missed anything the first time around (also as a refresher).

The repository will serve two purposes. One will be an ongoing catolouge of
my learnings, discoveries, and reviews. The other will be the experimental code
found in the `/src` directory.

With that, let's begin!
