Haskell doesn't have a return keyword
you can't assign a variable to a thing a second time
the `null` function below checks whether a list is empty
indentation means that you are continuing an existing definition
`xs` are everywhere. they mean 'plural of x'
Haskell is an expression-oriented language, not an imperitive one.
 - if an `if-else` expression only contains an `if`, then we do not have a full
   expression, and the compiler errors. This is because we don't give a type to
   the `else` branch.
