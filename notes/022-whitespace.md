The _offside rule_ is when haskell uses the whitespace structure to parse
sections of code. Note that top-level declarations can start at any column so
long as all subsequent declarations start in the same column. Similarly, a `let`
and `in` must both be in the same column.

Question: what happens in the ghci debugger when we step through a function -
do we read columns from the left-most of the file, or the left-most column which
starts the code section?

Note that comments are treated as empty lines. Also, for let/where clauses, that
any continuation lines are indented, while new definitions can be generated by
outdenting your definition.

As a rule of thumb, never use tabs. GHC will interpret tags to be of Unix size
(eight characters), while this may not be the case under different systems and
may cause things to break.

Note that the offside rule is not manditory! We can actually use explicit
structuring in a `let`-block with curly braces to indicate the definitions and
semi-colons to indicate line-breaks! This is valid for `where`-clauses,
top-level clauses, and `let`s. This would look like the following and allows
us to use unusual indentation:

    foo = let { a = 1; b = 2;
            c = 3 }
          in a + b + c;
