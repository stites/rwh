THE LAST CHAPTER! so exciting!

traditional threaded model of concurrent programming shares data among threads
and this is kept consistent using locks. threads are notified of changes using
condition variables

MVar is a little better, but still has the following issues:
- Race conditions due to forgotten locks.
- Deadlocks resulting from inconsistent lock ordering.
- Corruption caused by uncaught exceptions.
- Lost wakeups induced by omitted notifications.
