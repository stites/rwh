Now it's time to go over the typeclassopedia!

+ Solid arrows point from the general to the specific
+ Dotted arrows indicate some other sort of relationship.
+ Monad and ArrowApply are equivalent.
+ Semigroup, Apply and Comonad are greyed out since they are not actually (yet?) in the standard Haskell libraries.
  + Semigroup can be found in the semigroups package
  + Apply in the semigroupoids package
  + Comonad in the comonad package.
